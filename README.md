# Control: Taking Care of One's Mental Health

## How do you take care of your mental health?
There are various of ways on how a person can take care of their mental health.

Based on [Mental Health Foundation UK](https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/sites/default/files/How%20to...mental%20health.pdf), the number one way of looking after your mental health is by talking about your feelings. You can talk to someone or you can also write down your thoughts, often times providing a better way to reflect on your feelings.

This is where Control comes in! Control is a Java based application that lets you enter your moods for a given day and a corresponding optional journal entry. It provides a way to remind yourself that you are indeed in control of yourself and can take charge of your mental health.
